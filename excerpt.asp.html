        <p><i><font size="+1">Humanities Collections</font></i><font size="+1"> 
          1, no. 1 (1998): 41-56</font></p>
        <p><font size="+2">I</font> began VoS in late 1994 as a purely local knowledge 
          resource. While working on The Future Literary--my book-in-progress 
          on the evolving relation between the "well read" and the "well informed"--I 
          had for some time been systematically studying the Internet. This research 
          spilled over into the creation of courses, a Web-authoring collective, 
          and a how-to manual titled <i>The Ultrabasic Guide to the Internet for 
          Humanities Users at UCSB</i>--all inspired by the fact that, like the 
          self-aware computer at the end of William Gibson's <i>Neuromancer</i>, 
          I felt rather lonely online. There was a big wired universe out there, 
          but my local intellectual community (like most humanities communities 
          at the time) had barely discovered e-mail. To seduce this proximate 
          community onto the Internet, therefore, I set out in my courses and 
          manual to present the main skills needed to explore the Internet specifically 
          from the viewpoint of the humanities user or, as I called such a user, 
          the technological "savage." Typically, I began with housekeeping skills 
          (Unix commands, downloading and uploading, etc.) and then proceeded 
          through the various aspects of the Internet from FTP and telnet through 
          Gopher and WWW.</p>
        <p><font size="+2">V</font>ery soon, however, it became clear that I would 
          do best to concentrate on the one aspect of the Internet that seemed 
          custom-made for the technical savage or, as it were, Yahoo. This was 
          the Web, of course, which by now had proved both its general appeal 
          and its ability to subsume other components of the net. My agenda thus 
          simplified: I standardized on the Web as the route to the world beyond 
          e-mail, and I sought to make visible to my fellow humanists enough compelling 
          academic content that they would be motivated to explore on their own.</p>
        <p><font size="+2">I</font>t was to supply this content that I started 
          VoS in December 1994 as a UCSB-only site--necessarily campus-only, indeed, 
          since the Humanitas server at that time did not yet have a Web daemon 
          allowing it to serve up files globally. I gathered and organized links 
          of interest to humanists (working mainly in the Lynx text-only browser 
          for sheer speed). I solicited work from UCSB people for my "Featured 
          Works" section (rotating among the departments so that I could lure 
          fresh newcomers onto the Web to read the work of their colleagues or 
          mentors). And all this was accompanied by a constant production of e-mail 
          "press releases" about important new sites, new UCSB essays, and so 
          on, together with oft-repeated how-to instructions for beginners.</p>
        <p><font size="+2">W</font>hen on March 21, 1995, the Humanitas server 
          acquired a Web daemon, VoS went global. From this point on, the personality 
          of the page had to be adjusted to expand the relevance of page descriptions, 
          announcements, instructions, etc., originally addressed to the local 
          scholarly community. But such adjustments were more in the way of adding 
          further layers of local perspective than of undifferentiated globalism. 
          VoS now addressed the UCSB community plus concentric rings of wider, 
          yet still specialized, user communities. Or to adopt a better image: 
          the Web became from my viewpoint an archipelago of distinct islands 
          of users, each forming an ad hoc local community.</p>
        <p><font size="+2">D</font>ue to my literary background, of course, the 
          community that gathered around my literature pages (sending me correspondence, 
          making suggestions, etc.) was fullest and deepest. But from the start, 
          my Art, Religious Studies, and several other pages also acquired palpably 
          distinct user communities. A similar archipelago effect applies to the 
          geography of users. Most repeat visitors hail from the U. S., Canada, 
          and the U. K., but increasingly there are sizable minorities from Italy, 
          Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Mexico, and several other countries (plus 
          a constant stream of first-time visitors from all over). The fact that 
          such globalism is differential rather than homogenous is suggested by 
          events after a VoS mirror site went up in Italy. Suddenly I began receiving 
          e-mail from Italian users accompanied by suggestions of academic Web 
          sites originating in Italy. It was clear that an entire, discrete orbit 
          had been added to my user base. And in terms of sector- and age-groups, 
          too, the usage base has been similarly differential. As might be expected, 
          most visitors derive from higher-education institutions. But many also 
          come from the K-12 educational community and add a distinct flavor of 
          their own (suggesting teacher-oriented or student-written sites, sending 
          me innocently pushy letters in the mode of "Dear Sir, I have a book 
          report due tomorrow . . . Can you tell me who are the major characters 
          in <i>Moby Dick</i>?"). Even the surprisingly large number of "general 
          population" users (from the .com, .gov, .org, and .mil domains as well 
          as America Online, Prodigy, Compuserve, Netcom. etc.) seem paradoxically 
          "local" in personality. I mean by this that I often receive feedback 
          from such users in a "voice" that is distinctively self-conscious about 
          its placement relative to academe. For example, when a user fooled by 
          the "shuttle" in my title wrote to say that "as a working engineer I 
          wouldn't normally have stumbled onto your site, but I just had to see 
          what NASA had to say about the humanities"; or, again, when a correspondent 
          begins a letter, "I'm just an AOL'er, but I have a literature site that 
          may interest your readers"; the persona being expressed is a highly 
          "situated" version of the general population.</p>
        <p><font size="+2">O</font>nly occasionally do usage spikes generated 
          by the mention of VoS in some mass-circulation newspaper, magazine, 
          or Web-site (as occurred at various times when the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, 
          <i>New York Times</i>, and <i>USA Today</i> cited the page) create an 
          apparently undifferentiated global response. For instance, when the 
          CNN Website mentioned my VoS-related essay titled, <a href="http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/liu/whyuna.htm">"Should 
          We Link to the Unabomber? An Essay on Practical Web Ethics,"</a> over 
          3,000 visitors stopped by each day (a larger number at that time).</p>
        <p> <font size="+2">V</font>oS has grown to some 70 sub-pages covering 
          23-30 discrete disciplines (depending on how one counts them). The total 
          size of the site is about 3 Mb of links plus another 1 Mb in images 
          and other matter. Usage during the past academic year averaged from 
          800 to 1000 unique visiting machines per weekday, dropping back to 600-700 
          during the summer. (The number of users per individual machine is unknown.) 
        </p>
        <p><font size="+2">T</font>his leaves one further topic to be discussed 
          under the rubric of practice, which I save for last because it provides 
          a segue to the philosophy of the page. The topic is organization. </p>
        <p><font size="+2">I</font>f (loosely) VoS may be compared to a library 
          catalogue, then the matter of organization may be broached by asking 
          the interesting question: what is the page actually cataloging? It now 
          seems to me that there are three, interrelated answers to this question:</p>
        <p><font size="+2">F</font>irst, VoS simply catalogs the humanities as 
          currently organized in the modern research academy. The emphasis here 
          is on organization for "research." VoS thus breaks down knowledge first 
          by disciplinary field (e.g., classical studies, history, literature) 
          and then, within particular fields, by categories that map the internal 
          shape of the discipline (so far as I can discern them). Since the most 
          common distinction of humanistic fields from other branches of learning 
          is their historicity (literature departments, for example, teach the 
          history of literature), it is above all periodization that organizes 
          individual fields (e.g., the English literature page proceeds systematically 
          from the medieval period through the Renaissance, eighteenth century, 
          Romantics, and so on). But such other categorizing schemas as nationality 
          (e.g., British versus American literature), primary versus secondary 
          work, texts versus course syllabi, etc., add to the grid to reproduce 
          the basic arrangement of professional humanities research. In its very 
          form, then, VoS declares its essential content. The form says, "this 
          mode of organizing material by field, historical period, professional 
          activity, etc., is what research-level knowledge in the humanities means."</p>
        <p><font size="+2">B</font>ut, secondly, VoS catalogs not just the static 
          organization of humanistic knowledges in the research academy but also 
          the in-process reorganization of that knowledge. This means, above all, 
          that VoS is "interdisciplinary." I have written at length elsewhere 
          on interdisciplinarity in the academy. Here I will simply restate both 
          my agreement and eventual disagreement with Stanley Fish's trenchant 
          indictment of the vogue in his 1989 essay, "Being Interdisciplinary 
          is So Very Hard to Do." On the one hand, Fish is right that enthusiasts 
          of interdisciplinarity are only fooling themselves if they believe they 
          can ever really think their way out of the disciplinary frame of knowledge 
          in the academy (one ends up either colonizing other disciplines within 
          one's own discipline or, as in such cases as "Theory," institutes a 
          new meta-discipline). But on the other hand, I have argued, just because 
          disciplinary knowledge is epistemologically unavoidable in the institutional 
          setting does not mean that the impulse to go interdisciplinary is insignificant 
          or cannot have real ameliorative effects. Most importantly, it may be 
          added here, even if disciplinary knowledge is a necessity of the modern 
          professional academy, there is also the further matter of how this very 
          necessity is being repositioned by the interdisciplinary movement relative 
          to the powerful case for "interdisciplinary teams" in the new corporatism 
          (an issue I will return to below).</p>
        <p><font size="+2">F</font>or the moment, however, it is enough just to 
          point out that the some of the most interesting places in VoS are those 
          where the knowledge grid seems to break down. Thus, for example, I allow 
          for "topic" sections on some pages (e.g., "censorship studies," "corporeal 
          theory" on the Cultural Studies page) to register research "problems" 
          that are currently active in multiple disciplinary and historical fields. 
          So, too, I blur the humanities at its outer edges to register elements 
          of the sciences and social sciences. There is a page on <a href="http://vos.ucsb.edu/science.html">"Science, 
          Technology, and Culture,"</a> for example, because technology has <i>become</i> 
          a humanities problem through the mediation of such interdisciplinary 
          catch-all movements as <a href="http://vos.ucsb.edu/cultural.html">"cultural studies."</a> 
          And aside from all such blurrings of the disciplinary grid, of course, 
          the very fact that VoS places the traditional humanities all together 
          on the same menu--making it easy for the literature user, for example, 
          to satisfy an idle itch of curiosity about art just by lifting one finger--is 
          insidiously interdisciplinary. Since the early years of my own career 
          when I taught in both the Yale English department and interdisciplinary 
          British Studies Program (housed in the Yale British Art Center), I have 
          been troubled by how few scholars actually make it across the street, 
          say, from the English Dept. to the art museum. Whatever else, the Web 
          at least removes the street.</p>
        <p><font size="+2">F</font>inally, VoS also catalogs humanistic research 
          as it is in the process of creating new disciplines specific to the 
          information age. I am thus keenly active in collecting links for such 
          pages as <a href="http://vos.ucsb.edu/cyber.html">"Cyberculture"</a> and <a href="http://vos.ucsb.edu/techwrit.html">"Technology 
          of Writing,"</a> where scholarship no longer simply shovels print-ware 
          onto the net but instead invents ad hoc fields in which to think about, 
          with, or against the new media in the light of technical innovations 
          driven by and large by the corporate and mass sectors (as in the case 
          of "multimedia"). The fact that such fields as "cyberculture" now de 
          facto exist does not mean that traditional print- or library-paradigms 
          of knowledge are extinct (far from it), but that new schemas have evolved 
          for positioning scholarly knowledge-paradigms relative to the great 
          global 'information' paradigms of contemporary society. What "Cyberculture" 
          or "Technology of Writing" ultimately track, in other words, is not 
          technical development in itself but scholarly meditation on the changing 
          relation between old and new media, old and new knowledge worlds. An 
          especially good example is the section on <a href="http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/shuttle/techwrit.html#history">"History 
          of Language Technology"</a> on the "Technology of Writing" page, where 
          links to online resources on the historical instruments and media of 
          reading/writing (e.g., the "Classic Typewriter" page) allow us to re-see 
          literacy as specifically a predecessor "technology".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
