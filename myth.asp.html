        <p><font size="6">S</font>he aroused both his fury and his fear. He seized 
          her and <a href="myth.asp.html#cut2" name="cut1">cut out her tongue</a>. Then he 
          left her in a strongly <a href="myth.asp.html#prison2" name="prison1">guarded place</a> 
          and went to Procne with a story that Philomela had died on the journey.</p>
        <p><font size="6">P</font>hilomela's case looked hopeless. She was <a href="myth.asp.html#shutup2" name="shutup1">shut 
          up</a>; she could not speak; in those days there was no <a href="myth.asp.html#writing2" name="writing1">writing</a>. 
          It seemed that Tereus was safe. However, although people then could 
          not write, they could tell a story without <a href="myth.asp.html#voice2" name="voice1">speaking</a> 
          because they were marvelous craftsmen, such as have never been known 
          since. . . . Philomela accordingly turned to her loom. She had a greater 
          motive to make clear the story she wove than any artist ever had. With 
          infinite pains and surpassing skill she produced a wondrous <a href="myth.asp.html#web" name="writing2">tapestry</a> 
          on which the whole account of her wrongs was unfolded. She gave it to 
          the old woman who attended her and <a href="myth.asp.html#signify3" name="signify2">signified</a> 
          that it was for the Queen.</p>
        <p><font size="6">P</font>roud of bearing so beautiful a gift the aged 
          creature carried it to Procne, who was still wearing deep mourning for 
          her sister and whose spirit was as mournful as her garments. She unrolled 
          the <a href="index.asp.html" name="web">web</a>. There she saw Philomela, 
          her very face and form, and Tereus equally unmistakable. With horror 
          she read what had happened, all as plain to her as if in print.</p>

          Was worn from travel, and they came stepping down<br />
          To their own shores, and Tereus dragged her with him<br />
          To the deep woods, to some ramshackle building<br />
          Dark in that darkness, and he <a href="myth.asp.html#prison3" name="shutup3">shut 
          her in there</a>,<br />
          Pale, trembling, fearing everything, and asking<br />
          &quot;Where was her sister?&quot; And he told her then<br />
          What he was going to do, and straightway did <a href="myth.asp.html#it2" name="it1">it</a>,<br />
          <a href="myth.asp.html#it4" name="it3">Raped her</a>, a virgin all alone, and calling<br />

          Lay quivering, making a little <a href="myth.asp.html#voice4" name="voice3">murmur</a>,<br />
          Jerking and twitching, the way a serpent does<br />
          Run over by a wheel, and with <a href="myth.asp.html#it7" name="it6">it</a>s dying 
          movement<br />

        <p><font size="6">A</font>ristotle, in the <i>Poetics</i> (16.4), records 
          a striking phrase from a play by Sophocles, since lost, on the theme 
          of Tereus and Philomela. As you know, Tereus, having raped Philomela, 
          <a href="myth.asp.html#cut4" name="cut3">cut out her tongue</a> to prevent discovery. 
          But she weaves a <a href="myth.asp.html#writing2" name="signify3">tell-tale</a> account 
          of her violation into a tapestry (or robe) which Sophocles calls &quot;the 
          voice of the shuttle.&quot; If metaphors as well as plots or myths could 
          be archetypal, I would nominate Sophocles' voice of the shuttle for 
          that distinction. . . . </p>
        <p><font size="6">T</font>here is always something that violates us, deprives 
          our <a href="myth.asp.html#signify1" name="voice7">voice</a>, and compells art toward 
          an aesthetics of silence. &quot;Les yeux seuls sont encore capable de 
          pousser un cri,&quot; writes Char about his experiences in the second 
          World War. And Nelly Sachs, alluding to the suffering of her people: 
          &quot;Wailing Wall Night / Carved in you are the psalms of silence.&quot;</p>

        <hr />
        <p><font size="6">W</font>hen Philomela imagines herself free to tell 
          her own tale to anyone who will listen, Tereus realizes for the first 
          time what would come to light, should the woman's voice become public. 
          In private, <a href="myth.asp.html#it6" name="it5">force</a> is sufficient. In public, 
          however, Philomela's voice, if heard, would make them equal. <a href="myth.asp.html#shutup3" name="shutup2">Enforced 
          silence</a> and imprisonment are the means Tereus chooses to protect 
          himself from discovery. But as the mythic tale, Tereus' plot, and Ovid's 
          own text make clear, dominance can only contain, but never successfully 
          destroy, the woman's voice. . . .</p>
        <p><font size="6">W</font>hen Philomela begins to weave over the long 
          year of her <a href="myth.asp.html#prison4" name="prison3">imprisonment</a>, it is 
          not only her suffering but a specific motive that gives rise to her 
          new use of the loom: to <a href="myth.asp.html#voice7" name="voice6">speak</a> to 
          and be heard by her sister. As an instrument that binds and connects, 
          the loom, or its part, the shuttle, re-members or mends <a href="myth.asp.html#cut1" name="cut4">what 
          violence tears apart</a>: the bond between the sisters, the woman's 
          power to speak, a form of community and communication. War and weaving 
          are antithetical not because when women are weaving we are in our right 
          place, but because all of the truly generative activities of human life 
          are born of order and give rise to order. But just as Philomela can 
          weave any number of patterns on her loom, culture need not retain <a href="myth.asp.html#prison1" name="prison4">one 
          fixed structure</a>.&quot;</p>
