  <FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FF0000">2. How is VoS structured in its new database 
  environment?</FONT></P>
<P>In Fall 2001, VoS was converted from a static Web site into a dynamic database-to-Web 
  system. Instead of editing static HTML pages in Dreamweaver (or another Web-authoring 
  program), VoS developers now log on to the &quot;MyVoS&quot; part of the site 
  and use Web forms to enter or revise information in the underlying SQL Server 
  database. The database then takes care of selecting, organizing, and outputting 
  information requested by the end user (who navigates with links or uses the 
  &quot;search&quot; function) on an &quot;on-the-fly&quot; basis.</P>
<P>The dynamic structure of VoS means that while the main &quot;disciplines&quot; 
  and &quot;resources&quot; on the <a href="../../index.html">VoS home page</a> 
  are fixed, there is no fixed substructure analogous to a static HTML page and 
  its equally static subpages. In the old, static VoS, for example, the home page 
  (index.html) would have a first-level subpage like English Literature (english.html), 
  which in turn might have second-level subpages underneath it. But in the new, 
  dynamic VoS, clicking on <a href="../../browse.asp%3Fid=3.html">&quot;Literature 
  (in English&quot;)</a> will open a universal template page called &quot;browse.asp&quot; 
  whose URL also contains an instruction at the end like &quot;?id=3.&quot; (The 
  full URL of the English literature page is thus &quot;http://vos.ucsb.edu/browse.asp?id=3&quot;) 
  This tells the database to pull out of its stockpile of information a certain 
  &quot;category&quot; (the English lit category) and output it in the browse.asp 
  template. Every category has a specific id number, and categories can contain 
  any number of other categories and information items within them. Clicking on 
  a category like <a href="../../browse.asp%3Fid=1812.html">&quot;Metapages&quot;</a> 
  within the category of English Literature simply instructs the database to reuse 
  the browse.asp template with a new id number.</P>
<P><a name="drill_down"></a>The result is that a user can &quot;drill down&quot; 
  to as specific a category as s/he desires--all the way down to a category devoted 
  to pages from a specific site, for example--and have that category show up on 
  its own VoS page. For example, on the <a href="../../browse.asp%3Fid=3.html">English 
  Literature page</a> the user can click on <a href="../../browse.asp%3Fid=1812.html">&quot;Metapages&quot;</a> 
  to isolate just that category on its own page. Then the user can click within 
  the Metapages category on <a href="../../browse.asp%3Fid=125.html">&quot;About.com 
  Literature Pages&quot;</a> to isolate just the About.com sites on their own 
  page. In this example, the &quot;About.com Literature Pages&quot; category currently 
  has no other categories within it, only information items.</P>
<P>Understanding the principle of drilling down to the specific category one wishes 
  to work on (to add information items to, to reorder items, to move or copy items) 
  is important in editing VoS.</P>

  <FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FF0000">3. How to edit VoS? (basic instructions on the 
  VoS editing interface)</FONT></P>
<P>The following is a quick-start guide to the editing interface:</P>
<OL type="A">
  <li><b>Login:</b> Go to <a href="../../index.html">VoS</a> and click on the 
    link labeled &quot;MyVoS&quot; near the top of the screen. On the login screen 
    that appears, enter your user Name and Password.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Initial MyVoS Editing Screen:</b> After you have successfully logged 
    in, you will see the initial MyVoS editing screen as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <a href="images/MyVoS_Editing_Screen.GIF"><img src="images/MyVoS_Editing_Screen_small.GIF" alt="Initial MyVoS Editing Screen" width="240" height="185" border="1" align="absmiddle"></a> 
    <font size="-2">(click for larger image)<br>
    </font><br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Choose between editing the main VoS site or one of the VoS subprojects:</b> 
    The initial MyVos editing screen is the gateway to editing VoS or VoS subprojects. 
    Choose the function you wish as follows (you will only be allowed to edit 
    resources for which you have the appropriate permissions):<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>To edit the main VoS site, choose one of the functions under &quot;Editing&quot; 
        (usually &quot;Edit&quot;). This will present you with a screen that is 
        an editor's interactive version of the VoS site as it appears to the end 
        user. This screen allows the editor to browse to specific parts of the 
        site to work on.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="images/Edit_Text_Screen_for_VoS.GIF"><img src="images/Edit_Text_Screen_for_VoS_small.GIF" alt="Edit Text Screen for VoS" width="240" height="150" border="1"></a> 
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>To edit one of the subprojects, choose<a href="http://vos.ucsb.edu/browse-edit.asp?id=2920"> 
        &quot;EMC&quot;</a> or <a href="http://vos.ucsb.edu/browse-edit.asp?id=3203">&quot;UCSB 
        English Department Knowledge Base.&quot;</a> (Note: editors may have permissions 
        only for some subprojects.) The following, for example, is the initial 
        edit text screen for the Dept. Knowledge Base. This screen shows an editor's 
        interactive version of the part of the main VoS site devoted to the subproject. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="images/Edit_Text_Screen_for_Dept_Knowledge_Base.GIF"><img src="images/Edit_Text_Screen_for_Dept_Knowledge_Base_small.GIF" alt="Edit Text Screen for Dept. Knowledge Base" width="240" height="151" border="1"></a><br>
        <br>
        From the end-user's perspective, different subprojects appear on different 
        parts of the main VoS site; and they can also be seen on their own isolated 
        page by drilling down just to that category (<a href="vos2-FAQ.html#drill_down">see 
        above</a>). On the main VoS site, for example, the Dept. Knowledge Base 
        is a category located as follows: <a href="../../browse.asp%3Fid=2732.html">Teaching 
        Resources</a> &gt; <a href="../../browse.asp%3Fid=1197.html">General 
        Teaching Resources</a> &gt; <a href="../../browse.asp%3Fid=3203.html">UCSB 
        English Department Knowledge Base</a>. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Adding/Revising Categories and Information Items:</b> <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="vos2-FAQ.html#drill_down">Drill down</a> within the editing interface to 
        the category within which you wish to work (i.e., isolate that category 
        on its own VoS page). For example, if you want to add a category or information 
        item within the &quot;Test Category&quot; of the Dept. Knowledge Base, 
        first go in the editing interface to the Knowledge Base and then click 
        on &quot;Test Category&quot; to isolate that category on its own editing 
        screen.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="images/Edit_Text_Screen_for_a_Category.GIF"><img src="images/Edit_Text_Screen_for_a_Category_small.GIF" alt="Edit Text Screen for a Category" width="240" height="149" border="1"></a> 
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>For most editing purposes, you will be using the &quot;Edit&quot; as 
        opposed to &quot;Order&quot; mode (selectable at the top-right of the 
        editing screen). Within the Edit mode, you can choose one of the following 
        functions:<br>
        <br>
        --<b>Edit Category</b> This allows you to change the name of the category 
        you are working within.<br>
        <br>
        --<b>Add Category</b> This allows you to add a category <i>within</i> 
        the category you are working within. Generally, add a category only if 
        you expect to be adding multiple information items or links within that 
        category [use the &quot;Order by&quot; field to alphabetize the category 
        as you wish, usually with the first letters of the category title] [check 
        the &quot;Depth Flag&quot; field if you want the user to have to click 
        on a category before seeing its contents; otherwise in most circumstances 
        the contents of a category will show along with the category name. This 
        option allows editors to control how deep or flat the contents of a page 
        with many subcategories will be as it appears to the end user.] <br>
        <br>
        --<b>Add Info</b> This allows you to use the following screen to add information 
        items (i.e., links) to VoS:<br>
        <br>
        <a href="images/Add_Info_Screen.GIF"><img src="images/Add_Info_Screen_small.GIF" alt="Add Info Screen" width="240" height="150" border="1"></a> 
        <br>
        <br>
        For the VoS Stylesheet on the order, formatting, attribution, and other 
        details of links, <a href="vos2-FAQ.html#stylesheet">see below</a>. The main fields 
        in this Web form are as follows:<br>
        <br>
        *<u> Preliminary Details</u>: Use for author name and institutional affiliation 
        for links that have the equivalent of a print author (e.g., &quot;Jane 
        Doe (U. Florida)&quot;)<br>
        <br>
        * <u>Title of Site or Category Being Added</u>: Title of Link (this is 
        the text that will have the actual link within it). If you are adding 
        the home page of a site from which you expect to gather multiple links 
        within a category named for that site, title the home page &quot;Home 
        Page of [name of site]&quot; and not just &quot;home page.&quot; (This 
        is because the &quot;random URL&quot; feature on the VoS home page is 
        liable otherwise to pick out sites cryptically labeled only &quot;home 
        page&quot;; it also makes searching on sites difficult.) Thus, for example, 
        you might set up a category for &quot;About.com&quot;, then include a 
        number of links, the first of which would be &quot;Homepage of About.com&quot;<br>
        <br>
        *<u>Details About Site or Category if Needed</u>: Insert here information 
        about the site editor, annotation about the site, and other relevant details 
        as needed--all within parentheses. (See <a href="vos2-FAQ.html#stylesheet">Stylesheet</a> 
        for more on annotating sites) <br>
        <br>
        * <u>Default Order</u>: This field allows editors to control the order 
        of links within a category. For example, use &quot;0&quot; for the home 
        page of a site to be sure it appears at the top of a category; use the 
        first letters of a link for alphabetical order; use &quot;ZZ&quot; to 
        be sure a link appears at the bottom. There are other ways you can improvise 
        to order links inside a category.<br>
        <br>
        *<u>Vetted</u>: It is important to check this box. Otherwise, the link 
        you just added will appear only to editors and not to end-users on the 
        VoS site. (This feature was created because the public can sign up to 
        add links to VoS, but the links are kept &quot;unvetted&quot; until an 
        editor has screened them and modified them as needed.)<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>To revise an already existing link, just cleck on that link in the edit 
        text mode, and the previously entered link information will appear, ready 
        for revision.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Moving/Copying Categories and Information Items:</b><br>
    <br>
    Ideally, editors would never enter categories or links redundantly in VoS. 
    Instead, the principle is that there should be just one database entry for 
    a specific piece of information, and then the database should be instructed 
    to <i>present</i> that information in multiple or different locations on VoS 
    as needed. Rather than moving or copying actual information in the database, 
    in other words, editors are doing the equivalent of placing a &quot;shortcut&quot; 
    or &quot;pointer&quot; on their computer desktop--i.e., a pointer to the actual 
    location of a resource.<br>
    <br>
    The placement and copying of such pointers is handled automatically by the 
    Edit mode when a piece of information is first created. To move the location 
    of a category or link in VoS after the fact, or to duplicate a category or 
    link in another location in VoS, use the &quot;Order&quot; mode. This presents 
    the editor with a screen such as the following:<br>
    <br>
    <a href="images/Edit_Order_Screen.GIF"><img src="images/Edit_Order_Screen_small.GIF" alt="Edit Order Screen" width="240" height="147" border="1"></a> 
    <br>
    <br>
    There are three functions you can invoke from this screen:<br>
    <br>
    --<u>Reorder</u>: This allows an editor to revise the alphanumeric string 
    used to customize the order of a link within a category. You can manipuate 
    the Order string in an item to make a list of items appear in the order you 
    wish. For example, you can assign a string of &quot;0&quot; to make an item 
    appear at the top of a group of related items, and strings of &quot;a1,&quot; 
    &quot;b1,&quot; etc., to make subordinate items appear where appropriate (<A href="vos2-FAQ.html#example_ordering">see 
    example below</A>). <br>
    <br>
    --<u>Select</u>: This is the powerful function in the Edit Order mode. &quot;Selecting&quot; 
    a category or link tells the system that you want it to pay attention to this 
    particular item because you are about to move or copy its location on VoS. 
    After you select an item, you will see the &quot;Place Selection screen&quot; 
    as follows:<br>
    <br>
    <a href="images/Place_Selection_Screen.GIF"><img src="images/Place_Selection_Screen_small.GIF" alt="Pace Selection Screen" width="240" height="146" border="1"></a> 
    <br>
    <br>
    Click on the link on this page titled &quot;Place Selection.&quot; At that 
    point, you will be returned to the editor's browsing environment. Browse to 
    the exact category in VoS <i>within</i> which you want to either move or copy 
    your selection. So, for example, browsing to &quot;Architecture&quot; (i.e., 
    drilling down to isolate Architecture on its own VoS page in the editing interface) 
    will allow you to move or copy the selection into the Architecture category 
    at the top level of that category (along with any existing categories at the 
    top level within Architecture). If you wish to move or copy your selection 
    to a location within a sugcategory in Architecture like &quot;General Resources,&quot; 
    first drill down to that subcategory first.<br>
    <br>
    When you are at the proper location, choose &quot;Move&quot; or &quot;Copy&quot; 
    to execute the maneuver (you'll be prompted for a confirmation).<br>
    <br>
    You can move or copy entire categories. For example, the &quot;Science Fiction&quot; 
    category with any subcategories and all information items can be duplicated 
    under Science, Technology and Culture, under Literature, etc.<BR>
    <BR>
    --<A name="remove"></A><u>Remove</u>: This function allows you to remove the 
    current instance of an information item without deleting the item from the 
    database (where it may appear in other locations in VoS as well). (If you 
    are sure you want to delete the item from the database entirely, use the Delete 
    function in the Edit mode (<A href="vos2-FAQ.html#delete">see below</A>).) [Note: Currently, 
    the Remove function is not implemented for information items. It should be 
    working shortly.]<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><A name="delete"></A><b>Deleting categories and links:</b><br>
    Partly because of safety, the process of deleting information is a bit awkward 
    in VoS. While in the Edit mode, the &quot;delete&quot; button next to a link 
    will delete an individual link item. However, the delete button will not delete 
    a category item containing links or other categories within it unless you 
    first drill into that category and delete the materials there individually. 
    Note that deleting an item or category removes it entirely from the database 
    (and thus all instances of the item or category, which may appear in multiple

  go to collect links?</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2"> </FONT></P>
<P>VoS is conservative in collecting subpages or sections within a site. Usually 
  the user is best served with just a link to the home page of the site plus, 
  where appropriate, a brief descriptive annotation. In the case of important 
  or large sites, however, VoS sometimes collects links not just to the home page 
  but to the main top-level pages. These latter links are presented in a subordinate 
  list under the main link. Alternatively, VoS may harvest only selected resources. 
  For example:</P>

<P>You can manipuate the Order string in an item to make a list of items appear 
  in the order you wish. For example, you can assign a string of &quot;a0&quot; 
  to make an item appear at the top, and strings of &quot;a1,&quot; &quot;b1,&quot; 
  etc., to make subordinate items appear where appropriate. <BR>
  <BR>
  In general, however, be careful not to over-collect links from a site because 
  this leads to problems maintaining VoS in the future. Sites often change their

<P>Generally, VoS follows the principle of putting general resources for an author 
  or topic near the top of a listing, more specific resources (e.g., links to 
  essays or books) further down, and critical works at the bottom. Where there 
  are few links for an author or topic, there is no need for formal organization 
  of the links. But where there are many links or where it otherwise seems to 
  make sense, Vos uses variants of the following organizational scheme (note the 
  use of subordinate lists and boldfaced section headings):</P>

  <FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#FF0000">6. What is the citation style for VoS entries?</FONT><FONT SIZE="+2"> 
  </FONT></P>
<P>VoS has followed a consistent, simplified citation style over the years, with 
  variants. The main principle is that VoS is not a print bibliography that requires 
  full citations but a functioning hypertext guide that adds only enough information 
  to allow users to see at a glance the gist of a link, its author or source, 
  and (usually through institutional affiliation) its rough level of &quot;authority.&quot; 
  For the latter purpose, institutions but not departments or ranks are included 
  (because otherwise it becomes impossible to keep VoS up to date)--though sometimes 
  it is appropriate to mention department or rank in the description of a link 
  (e.g., &quot;an undergraduate journal&quot;).</P>

<OL type="A">
  <LI><B>Author Designation (Content-Author vs. Web-Author):</B> Content-authors 
    (e.g., authors of essays) come before the link to the site; Web-authors (the 
    individuals, journals, or Web sites) responsible for the Web site are named 
    after the link. Where the content-author is also the Web-author (e.g., someone 
    who writes and essay and puts it on his or her home page), only the content-author 
    is mentioned. Web pages that do not have print analogues (e.g., VoS itself) 
    have only a Web-author. Multiple authors may be listed. Where the authorship 
    is some kind of collaborative venture, use a slash &quot;/&quot; (e.g., U. 
    Penn. / U. Virginia). Where a link is from a large site, it is sometimes best 
    to cite the name of the site as the author rather than the individual responsible 
    for the site (e.g., &quot;The Write Page&quot;). </LI>
  <LI><B>Institutional Affiliation:</B> Use these conventions: Delaware U., U. 
    of Tennessee, Bowdoin C. Where the institution is unlikely to be recognized, 
    add some geography (e.g., Abnormal C., Trenton, NJ). Assume that users may 
    be from other parts of the world and may not recognize common U.S. acronyms 
    for institutions (so use &quot;U. California, Santa Barbara,&quot; not &quot;UCSB&quot;). 
    Omit institutional affiliations in cases where there are three or more authors.</LI>
  <LI><B>Link Titles:</B> Cite the title as you find it on the site and use normal 
    conventions (quotes, italics, etc.) to indicate the genre of the resource 
    (Web pages without a print analogue appear in normal text). Use your judgment 
    about including full or long titles, which can sometimes add descriptive value 
    (e.g., &quot;<I>Apple: the Journal Devoted to Theory of Fruit</I>&quot;). 
    <B>Date:</B> Note the inclusion of year of publication (if known) in parentheses 
    within the link-title of essays, books, etc.</LI>
  <LI><B>Descriptions:</B> Where it is clear what a resource is (by its title 
    or placement in a particular section of VoS), no description is needed. Often, 
    for example, resources such as the following require no description: &quot;John 
    Donne page,&quot; &quot;<I>Keats-Shelley Journal</I>&quot;. Otherwise, it 
    is useful to add a concise description--perhaps compounded from brief quotations 
    from the site supplemented by other matter. For example: (&quot;highly accurate 
    and reliable electronic editions of works&quot; encoded in SGML/TEI; with 
    HTML versions). Descriptions are included in parentheses; and semi-colons 
    are preferred to periods. Normally, VoS removes upper-case at the beginning 
    of a quoted sentence. VoS does not normally include evaluative language in 
    a description (e.g., &quot;good,&quot; superb,&quot; &quot;brilliant,&quot; 
    etc.). Instead, VoS uses descriptive or analytical language to achieve the 
    same effect (e.g., mentions of what a site includes, use of such words as 
    &quot;extensive,&quot; &quot;well-organized,&quot; &quot;annotated,&quot; 
    etc.)
